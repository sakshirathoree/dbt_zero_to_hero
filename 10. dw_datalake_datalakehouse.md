### üìä Data Lake vs Data Warehouse vs Data Lakehouse

| Feature         | **Data Lake**                                                                                           | **Data Warehouse**                                            | **Data Lakehouse**                                                              |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Data Types**  | Stores **all data**: raw, structured, semi-structured (JSON, XML), unstructured (images, videos, logs). | Stores **structured data only** (tables, rows, columns).      | Stores **all data types** (structured + unstructured).                          |
| **Purpose**     | Cheap storage for large volumes of diverse data.                                                        | Optimized for **analytics, reporting, BI**.                   | Unified platform for both **analytics + AI/ML use cases**.                      |
| **Schema**      | **Schema-on-read** (you define structure when reading).                                                 | **Schema-on-write** (data must be structured before loading). | Supports both approaches.                                                       |
| **Performance** | Raw storage, needs external engines (Spark, Presto, Databricks) for queries.                            | High-performance SQL queries, OLAP optimized.                 | SQL-level performance on top of data lakes.                                     |
| **Cost**        | Very cheap (object storage like S3, ADLS, GCS).                                                         | More expensive (compute + licenses + optimization).           | Cheaper than DW (lake storage) + better performance than DL.                    |
| **Scalability** | Infinite scalability (cheap cloud storage).                                                             | Scales but costlier (compute nodes, licenses).                | Scalable storage + scalable compute.                                            |
| **Users**       | Data engineers, data scientists (for ML/AI, raw data).                                                  | Business analysts, BI teams (dashboards, reports).            | Both BI + ML/AI teams (unified platform).                                       |
| **Examples**    | AWS S3, ADLS Gen2, Google Cloud Storage, HDFS.                                                          | Snowflake, Redshift, BigQuery, Teradata.                      | Databricks Delta Lake, Apache Iceberg, Apache Hudi, Snowflake (newer features). |
| **Challenges**  | Can become a ‚Äú**data swamp**‚Äù if not governed.                                                          | Expensive, rigid (not good for unstructured data).            | Still evolving, relatively new concept.                                         |

‚úÖ **One-liner to remember for interview:**

* **Data Warehouse** ‚Üí ‚ÄúClean kitchen for ready-to-eat meals‚Äù (structured data for BI).
* **Data Lake** ‚Üí ‚ÄúHuge pantry where everything is dumped‚Äù (all raw data).
* **Data Lakehouse** ‚Üí ‚ÄúSmart kitchen + pantry combined‚Äù (best of both worlds).

Would you like me to also make a **small diagram/pyramid-style visual** (like we did for data maturity) so you can quickly recall these three in interviews?
