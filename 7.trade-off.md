You know now that there are trade offs, whichever way you go, whether you decide to build an on premise
or a cloud data warehouse.

### **What does “trade-off” mean?**

A **trade-off** means that when you choose one option, you **gain some benefits but also lose something else**.

* It’s about **balancing pros and cons**.
* You can’t get *all* the advantages in one option — you must **sacrifice** something to gain something else.

### **In the context of Data Warehouses**

When we say *“there are huge trade-offs between on-premise and cloud data warehouses”*:

* **On-Premise DWs**

  * ✅ Pros: Full control, compliance flexibility.
  * ❌ Cons: Expensive, hard to scale, high maintenance.

* **Cloud DWs**

  * ✅ Pros: Easy to scale, low maintenance, predictable pricing.
  * ❌ Cons: Less control, vendor lock-in, data transfer costs.

👉 The **trade-off** is: if you choose **on-premise**, you gain control but sacrifice cost-efficiency and scalability.
If you choose **cloud**, you gain scalability and ease but sacrifice control and risk vendor dependency.

✅ **One-liner definition you can use in interviews:**
*A trade-off means choosing one option at the expense of another — you gain certain benefits but must accept some drawbacks.*

Do you want me to give you a **simple real-world analogy** (like buying vs renting a house) to explain trade-offs more naturally in an interview?
