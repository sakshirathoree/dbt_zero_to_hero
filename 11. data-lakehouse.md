Got it 👍 I’ll keep your sentences as they are (especially the start part) and then structure them into clear, interview-ready notes. I’ll also add extra context where useful so you get the **full picture of the Lakehouse concept**.

### 📒 Notes on Data Lakehouse

* **The Lakehouse concept emerged due to the limitations of data lakes.**
* It essentially combines the **best features of data lakes and data warehouses.**

---

### 🔹 Key Features of a Data Lakehouse

* In the case of a lakehouse, we have **very similar data structure and data management features** that we have in our data warehouse.
* However, it **sits on top of low-cost cloud storage.**
* What’s great in a Lakehouse:

  * **Cost-efficient storage** provided by your cloud provider (e.g., Amazon S3, ADLS2, GCS).
  * **ACID transactional support** → ensures data consistency, reliability, and correctness.
  * **Schema stored in a Lakehouse Metastore** → helps enforce structure and governance.
  * Ability to **evolve the schema of your tables without copying the dataset** (schema evolution).
  * **Governance & access control** → manage permissions, security, and compliance.
  * Provides **interfaces to connect BI tools** (e.g., Tableau, Power BI, Looker, Superset).

### 🔹 Why Lakehouse? (Additional Info)

* **Limitations of Data Lakes**:

  * Raw/unstructured storage only → no ACID transactions.
  * Hard to enforce governance.
  * Can easily become a “data swamp.”
* **Limitations of Data Warehouses**:

  * Expensive.
  * Not suitable for unstructured/semi-structured data.
* **Lakehouse bridges the gap** by combining:

  * **Scalability + low cost** of a data lake.
  * **Reliability + governance + SQL performance** of a data warehouse.

### 🔹 Popular Lakehouse Implementations

* **Databricks Delta Lake**
* **Apache Iceberg**
* **Apache Hudi**
* Snowflake (adding Lakehouse-style features)

---

✅ **One-liner for interview:**
*A Data Lakehouse combines the cheap, scalable storage of a Data Lake with the performance, reliability, and governance of a Data Warehouse — giving the best of both worlds.*

Would you like me to also create a **short timeline/evolution flow (DW → DL → Lakehouse)** so you can explain how the Lakehouse concept naturally emerged?
