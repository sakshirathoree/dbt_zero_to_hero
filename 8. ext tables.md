# **Trade-offs in Data Warehouses & External Tables**

* **You know now that there are trade offs, whichever way you go, whether you decide to build an on premise or a cloud data warehouse.**
* Both designs have issues you must consider:

---

## **1. Common Issues in Data Warehouses**

* **Compute Costs**

  * You pay for compute nodes whether they are fully used or not.
  * With **large datasets**, costs become very high.
  * Even with **small datasets** but high analytical workloads, costs rise significantly.

* **Underutilization**

  * If storage is underused but queries are heavy, you still face high costs.

* **Scaling Limitations**

  * Autoscaling exists, but it may not always handle **peak workloads** effectively.
  * Risk of slowdowns or bottlenecks during heavy traffic.

---

## **2. Solution: External Tables**

* External tables let you **decouple compute from storage**.
* You can store large files **outside the data warehouse** (e.g., Amazon S3, Azure Blob, Google Cloud Storage).
* From the user‚Äôs perspective, querying feels the same as normal DW tables.

### **Benefits**

* **Independent scaling** of compute and storage.
* **Lower costs** ‚Üí object storage (S3, Blob, GCS) is much cheaper than DW storage.
* Cloud provider fully manages the underlying **serverless infrastructure**.

---

## **3. Structured vs Unstructured Data**

* **Structured Data** (tables, logs, CSVs, Parquet, etc.) ‚Üí handled efficiently via external tables.
* **Unstructured Data** (images, videos, text files, audio) ‚Üí not supported by DWs.

  * Solution: Use **Data Lakes** or modern **Lakehouse** architectures.
  * Examples: Databricks, BigLake, Snowflake (with unstructured data support).

---

## **4. Key Takeaways**

* External tables = flexibility + cost efficiency.
* Use data warehouse for **clean, structured, optimized data** (dashboards, reporting).
* Store raw, bulk, or unstructured data in **Data Lakes**.
* Industry trend = **Lakehouse model** (mix of DW + Data Lake).

Would you like me to also add a **short interview-ready summary (3‚Äì4 lines)** you can directly say if asked about external tables or trade-offs?
