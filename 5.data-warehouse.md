# **Data Warehouses (DW/DWS)**

- The purpose of a data warehouse is to serve as the technology for data analytics and reporting. 
- It's nothing more than a database that lets us do high performance, optimized analytics on our data and with which we can create dimensions, facts, and handle denormalization(flattening data for faster query performance.)
- These databases work really well with columnar storage formats and complex data types, but they can't handle unstructured data such as images or videos.
- Typically, you interact with a data warehouse by executing SQL against it, so data warehouse is nothing more than a performant engine that lets us do analytics workloads on our data using SQL.
- A DW is a performant engine that enables running analytics workloads efficiently with SQL.
- DWs are widely used for reporting and dashboarding.
- Therefore, it is critical to keep DW data structured and clean, so answering business questions doesn’t take days or weeks.

## **Evolution of Data Warehouses**

* **Earlier (On-Premise DWs):**

  * Vendors: **IBM, Oracle**, etc.
  * Organizations managed both **hardware and software**.
  * Provided complete **control** over setup (storage size, compute, memory).
  * Suitable for **strict regulatory compliance** environments.

* **Now (Cloud DWs):**

  * Vendors: **Amazon Redshift, Snowflake, Google BigQuery**, etc.
  * Became popular with **cloud computing adoption**.
  * Enterprises are shifting towards cloud DWs because of **ease of maintenance, scalability, and cost benefits**.

---

## **On-Premise DWs: Pros & Cons**

* **Pros:**

  * Full **control** over infrastructure (hardware, software, compute, storage).
  * Good fit for **compliance-heavy industries**.

* **Cons:**

  * **High total cost of ownership (TCO):** hardware, licenses, electricity, maintenance.
  * Requires hiring specialized staff (**sysadmins, network engineers**).
  * **Harder to scale** – need new machines + procurement cycles.
  * **License management** with vendors adds complexity.

---

## **Cloud DWs: Pros & Cons**

* **Pros:**

  * **Easy to maintain** – provider handles infrastructure.
  * **Transparent, predictable pricing**.
  * **Highly scalable** – add/remove compute nodes on demand.
  * Provider assigns a **leader node** to manage distributed compute nodes.

* **Cons:**

  * Potential **vendor lock-in** (dependence on one cloud ecosystem).
  * **Data egress costs** if moving data out of the provider’s cloud.

---

✅ **High-Level Summary:**

* A data warehouse is a **SQL-based, high-performance database for analytics**.
* **On-Prem DWs** = control but expensive and hard to scale.
* **Cloud DWs** = scalable, easy, cost-efficient, but risk of lock-in.

RJ, do you also want me to make a **“DW at a glance” one-pager** (super short 5–6 bullets only) that you can use for **last-minute revision before interviews**?



-------------------------------

## **1. Definition & Purpose**

* A **Data Warehouse (DW)** is a specialized database designed for **data analytics and reporting**.
* Core role: store structured data in a way that supports **high-performance, optimized analytics**.
* Enables creation of:

  * **Facts** (measurable data, e.g., sales revenue, clicks).
  * **Dimensions** (contextual data, e.g., date, location, customer).
  * **Denormalization** (flattening data for faster query performance).

✅ **Key Point:** A DW is **not for transactions** (like an OLTP system) but for **analytics (OLAP)**.

---

## **2. Capabilities**

* Optimized for **columnar storage** → better compression & query speed.
* Handles **complex data types** (JSON, semi-structured logs, etc.).
* Cannot directly handle **unstructured data** (images, audio, video).
* Interfaced using **SQL queries** (the universal language of DWs).

✅ **Why it matters:** DWs power **reporting, dashboarding, BI tools** (e.g., Tableau, Power BI, Looker).
Clean and structured data inside the DW ensures quick answers to business questions.

---

## **3. Evolution**

* **1960s–2000s:** On-premises DWs (e.g., IBM, Oracle, Teradata).
* **2010s onwards:** Cloud-based DWs (e.g., Amazon Redshift, Snowflake, Google BigQuery).

---

## **4. On-Premises Data Warehouses**

### **Advantages**

* Full **control** of hardware, storage, and compute.
* Better for **strict compliance/regulatory requirements** (data sovereignty, privacy laws).
* Hardware and software are owned → customizable.

### **Disadvantages**

* **High upfront cost**: licenses, servers, networking, electricity.
* **Maintenance burden**: sysadmins, DBAs, network engineers.
* **Scaling is hard**: new hardware → procurement delays.
* **Failure risk**: hardware breakdowns mean downtime and replacements.

---

## **5. Cloud Data Warehouses**

### **Advantages**

* **Low maintenance**: cloud provider manages infrastructure.
* **Elastic scaling**: add/remove compute nodes on demand.
* **Predictable pricing**: pay-as-you-go model.
* **Faster time-to-value**: spin up a warehouse in minutes.
* High availability & redundancy built-in.

### **Disadvantages**

* Less granular **control** compared to on-prem.
* Potential **vendor lock-in**.
* Compliance may be trickier for highly regulated industries (banks, defense).

---

## **6. Examples**

* **On-Prem:** IBM DB2, Oracle Exadata, Teradata.
* **Cloud:** Amazon Redshift, Snowflake, Google BigQuery, Azure Synapse.

## **7. On-Prem vs Cloud: Comparison Table**

| Feature         | On-Prem DW                              | Cloud DW                        |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Control**     | Full hardware + software control        | Limited (managed by provider)   |
| **Compliance**  | Strong (good for strict regulations)    | Can be tricky depending on laws |
| **Scalability** | Manual, requires buying new hardware    | Elastic, auto-scalable          |
| **Maintenance** | High (admins, patching, hardware fixes) | Low (provider manages infra)    |
| **Cost Model**  | High upfront + ongoing infra costs      | Pay-as-you-go / subscription    |
| **Setup Time**  | Months (procurement + installation)     | Minutes to hours                |

## **8. Additional Usable Info (for Interviews)**

* **OLTP vs OLAP**:

  * OLTP (databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL): optimized for transactions.
  * OLAP (data warehouses): optimized for analytics/aggregations.
* **Data Lakes vs Data Warehouses**:

  * Data Lake: stores raw, unstructured data (cheaper, flexible).
  * Data Warehouse: stores structured, analytics-ready data (faster insights).
* **Modern Trend → Lakehouse**:

  * Blend of **Data Lake + Data Warehouse** (e.g., Databricks Lakehouse).
* **Common DW Use Cases**:

  * Business Intelligence dashboards.
  * Executive reporting (sales trends, churn analysis).
  * Machine Learning feature store preparation.

---

✅ **Key Takeaway for Interviews**:
*A data warehouse is a high-performance database optimized for analytics. Historically, DWs were on-prem with high costs and complexity, but now cloud-based DWs dominate due to scalability, cost-efficiency, and ease of use. Businesses rely on DWs for reporting, BI, and data-driven decision-making.*
