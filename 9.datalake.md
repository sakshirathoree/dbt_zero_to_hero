Got it 👍 I’ll structure your notes into clear bullet points, keeping your original sentences (especially the start part) as they are, and also add extra useful info you should know.

### 📒 Notes on Data Lakes

* **Now we know what to do when storing structured data, therefore that we use the data warehouse.**
* But let's take the time to explore what happens when we have to deal with **unstructured or semi-structured data.**
* There is this concept of a **data lake.**

---

### 🔹 What is a Data Lake?

* You can think of a data lake as a **repository**, where you can put all kinds of data ranging from:

  * Raw data
  * Cleansed data
  * **Unstructured** data (e.g., images, videos, PDFs, text logs)
  * **Semi-structured** data (e.g., JSON, XML, Avro, Parquet, CSV)
* It is like a **very scalable file system.**

  * **On-premise:** This is called **HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System).**
  * **On cloud:** Examples are **Amazon S3**, **Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (ADLS2)**, **Google Cloud Storage (GCS).**

---

### 🔹 Key Characteristics of a Data Lake

* **Storage only, no compute integrated**

  * The point of the data lake is to store files, not process them.
  * You attach compute engines (like Spark, Databricks, Presto, Snowflake) when you need analytics.
* **Separation of storage and compute**

  * If your analytical workloads increase, you can scale compute instances independently of storage.
  * Cloud providers handle this efficiently with **external tables** and **serverless infrastructure.**

---

### 🔹 Integration with Analytics Platforms

* If you use **Databricks** or **Snowflake**:

  * These providers store your data in the **data lake by default.**
  * They only provide you with **analytical clusters** that you can set up the way you want.
  * Example:

    * If your workloads are big → provision a bigger cluster.
    * If your workloads are small → scale down to save cost.

### 🔹 Additional Information You Should Know

* **Data Lake vs Data Warehouse**

  * **Data Warehouse** → optimized for **structured data** + SQL analytics.
  * **Data Lake** → stores **all data types** (raw, structured, semi/unstructured).
* **Data Lakehouse** (modern concept):

  * A **hybrid** of data warehouse and data lake.
  * Supports structured + unstructured data, with SQL performance on top of cheap object storage.
  * Technologies: **Databricks Delta Lake, Apache Iceberg, Apache Hudi.**
* **Challenges of Data Lakes:**

  * Without governance, they can become **“data swamps”** (messy, hard to use).
  * Need metadata management, cataloging (e.g., AWS Glue Catalog, Hive Metastore).

---

✅ In short:

* **Data Warehouse → Structured, SQL, reporting.**
* **Data Lake → Raw, unstructured/semi-structured, scalable storage.**
* **Data Lakehouse → Combines both worlds.**

Would you like me to also create a **comparison table (Data Lake vs Data Warehouse vs Data Lakehouse)** so you can revise quickly before an interview?
