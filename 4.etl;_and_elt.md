Absolutely, RJ! Here’s a **clean, organized set of notes** on **ETL vs ELT**, keeping your original content intact but structured, and adding extra context/facts for clarity.

# **ETL vs ELT: Organized Notes**

## **Introduction**

* After understanding the **Data Maturity Model**, it’s important to understand **ETL and ELT procedures**.
* ETL became widespread historically due to **constraints in storage and computation**.
* Modern cloud computing and cheap storage have made ELT the dominant approach today.

---

## **1. Historical Context: Why ETL was popular**

* **Riddle example:** A 1 MB hard drive in 1967 cost **\$1 million**.
* **Implication:** Storage was expensive; computation resources were limited.
* **Constraints faced by data engineers:**

  * Single-node databases with limited compute.
  * Expensive on-prem resources due to licensing and hardware costs.
  * Scaling was difficult.
* **Solution:** Transform data **outside the database** in a staging area → the ETL workflow.

---

## **2. ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)**

### **Workflow**

1. **Extract** – Collect data from source systems.
2. **Transform** – Clean, standardize, and structure data **before loading**.
3. **Load** – Insert transformed data into the target database/warehouse.

### **Advantages**

* Reduces load on the destination database.
* Useful when **compute and storage are scarce**.

### **Challenges / Limitations**

* Schema changes in sources can **break models**.
* Difficult to handle **high-velocity or streaming data**.
* Scaling ETL pipelines is complex.
* Adding new sources or connections takes significant time.
* Testing and debugging ETL pipelines is cumbersome.

✅ **Key takeaway:** ETL made sense in the era of **expensive compute/storage**, but it’s less flexible for today’s dynamic data environments.

---

## **3. ELT (Extract, Load, Transform)**

### **Why ELT emerged**

* **Storage and compute are cheap** today (e.g., \$0.02 per GB).
* Modern cloud data warehouses (Snowflake, Redshift, BigQuery) are **highly scalable and performant**.
* Transformations can now happen **inside the warehouse** instead of an external staging area.

### **Workflow**

1. **Extract** – Collect data from sources.
2. **Load** – Load **raw data directly** into the data warehouse.
3. **Transform** – Clean, integrate, and model data **inside the warehouse**.

### **Advantages**

* Easier to scale with modern cloud warehouses.
* Faster onboarding of **new data sources**.
* Schema changes can be handled more flexibly.
* Testing, debugging, and iterating transformations is simpler.
* Tools like **Fivetran, Stitch, Airbyte** automate extraction and loading → only transformations remain manual/customizable.

✅ **Key takeaway:** ELT leverages **modern cloud infrastructure** to simplify and accelerate analytics workflows.

## **4. Transform Step in ELT**

* While extract and load are often automated, **T (transform)** is still critical:

  * Clean messy data.
  * Apply business logic.
  * Build analytics-ready models (e.g., via **DBT**).

## **5. Comparison Table: ETL vs ELT**

| Feature                          | ETL                                             | ELT                                                 |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Workflow**                     | Extract → Transform → Load                      | Extract → Load → Transform                          |
| **Where transformation happens** | Outside the database (staging area)             | Inside the database/warehouse                       |
| **Best for**                     | Legacy on-prem systems, limited compute/storage | Modern cloud warehouses, scalable workloads         |
| **Scalability**                  | Hard to scale                                   | Easy to scale                                       |
| **Schema changes**               | Can break pipelines                             | Easier to handle                                    |
| **Tools**                        | Informatica, Talend, SSIS                       | Fivetran, Stitch, Airbyte + DBT for transformations |
| **Data freshness**               | Usually batch-oriented                          | Supports near real-time pipelines                   |

## **6. Key Takeaways**

* **ETL**: Classic approach, works for constrained environments; transformations are external.
* **ELT**: Modern approach, leverages cheap storage and cloud warehouses; transformations are internal.
* **Modern workflow**: Use ELT for loading raw data quickly, then DBT or similar tools for transforming it into analytics-ready models.
