A Data Maturity Model is like a roadmap that shows where an organization stands today in terms of data capabilities and what steps it needs to take to progress.


# **Notes: Data Maturity Model / Data Hierarchy of Needs**

### **Conceptual Analogy**

* Inspired by **Maslow‚Äôs Hierarchy of Needs**.
* Just as humans must satisfy basic needs before moving to higher levels, organizations must first meet **fundamental data needs** before achieving advanced capabilities.
* Skipping stages leads to fragile foundations and likely failure.

---

### **Stages of the Data Hierarchy (Adapted Pyramid)**

#### **1. Data Collection (Foundation Layer)**

* Capturing relevant, high-quality data from various sources.
* Without this stage, nothing else in analytics or engineering can exist.
* Includes:

  * Data ingestion from APIs, apps, sensors, and third-party systems.
  * Logging and event collection.
  * Storage in raw form (files, databases, streams).

‚úÖ Additional Note: At this stage, focus is on **completeness, availability, and reliability** of raw data.

---

#### **2. Data Cleaning & Integration**

* Transforming raw data into structured, usable formats.
* Key activities:

  * Removing duplicates, handling missing values.
  * Standardizing schemas and formats.
  * Building **integration flows** between systems (ETL / ELT pipelines).
* Goal: Prepare **trusted, consistent datasets** for downstream use.

‚úÖ Additional Note: DBT plays a **major role here**, especially for transformations (T in ELT).

---

#### **3. Data Storage & Modeling**

* Loading clean, transformed data into centralized repositories:

  * **Data Warehouses** (Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift).
  * **Data Lakes** (S3, ADLS, GCS).
  * **Lakehouses** (Databricks, Delta Lake).
* Structured modeling ensures data is **organized, queryable, and performant**.
* This stage ensures scalability for analytics and advanced use cases.

‚úÖ Additional Note: This is where DBT integrates tightly with warehouses to create **semantic layers** and **data models**.

---

#### **4. Business Analytics & Reporting**

* Leveraging the data for decision-making.
* Outputs: Dashboards, reports, KPIs, self-service BI.
* Typical tools: Looker, Tableau, Power BI, Mode.
* Ensures stakeholders can **see and act on insights**.

‚úÖ Additional Note: DBT models form the **semantic layer** that BI tools consume directly.

---

#### **5. Advanced Use Cases (Optional in This Course)**

*(Top of the pyramid, not covered deeply here)*

* **Machine Learning (ML):** Predictive modeling, personalization, recommendation engines.
* **Artificial Intelligence (AI):** Intelligent decision-making, NLP, automation.
* Organizations need **solid lower layers** to succeed here.

---

### **Key Takeaways**

* Data maturity is **evolutionary** and **sequential**.
* Jumping to advanced layers (BI, ML, AI) without strong **data collection, cleaning, and storage practices** leads to fragile systems.
* DBT and **analytics engineering** sit primarily in **Stages 2‚Äì4**:

  * Cleaning & transforming data.
  * Structuring it in a warehouse/lakehouse.
  * Serving analytics-ready models for BI.

Got it üëç Thanks for clarifying ‚Äî the picture you saw is a **simplified pyramid** that maps directly to the **core layers** relevant to most data-driven organizations. Let‚Äôs structure the notes accordingly, while still keeping the context you‚Äôve already written down.

---

### **1. Data Collection (Foundation)**

* Capturing raw data from multiple sources.
* Examples: Application logs, APIs, IoT devices, third-party services.
* Without this stage ‚Üí no analytics or AI possible.
* Focus: **Availability & reliability** of raw inputs.

---

### **2. Data Wrangling**

* Initial processing of raw data.
* Includes:

  * Cleaning missing/duplicate data.
  * Standardizing formats.
  * Handling schema differences.
* Goal: Turn messy raw data into structured, usable datasets.

---

### **3. Data Integration**

* Combining data from different systems into a unified view.
* Involves **ETL/ELT pipelines**, often powered by DBT in modern stacks.
* Loads into centralized repositories (warehouses, lakes, lakehouses).
* Focus: **Consistency, governance, and scalability**.

Data integration.
- This step is all about writing our transform data from the staging area to a target database, where the analytics workloads will be performed.

- We can do loading two ways by doing a refresh, aka rewriting the data completely, which will replace
our old data.

Or we can do an update where only the changes we apply to the source data will be added to the data
warehouse.

---

### **4. Business Intelligence (BI) & Analytics**

* Turning data into insights through dashboards, reports, and visualizations.
* Stakeholders (business teams, leadership) consume data at this level.
* Tools: Power BI, Tableau, Looker, Mode.
* DBT plays a role here by producing **analytics-ready models**.

---

### **5. Artificial Intelligence (AI)**

* The top of the pyramid ‚Äî advanced use cases.
* Builds on strong foundations from previous layers.
* Examples: Machine learning models, predictive analytics, recommendation systems, NLP.
* Not the focus of this course, but crucial for long-term maturity.

---

### **Key Observations**

* The pyramid shows **progression**:

  * You **can‚Äôt jump to BI or AI** without having solid data collection, wrangling, and integration in place.
* DBT sits mainly in:w

  * **Data Wrangling** (transformations).
  * **Data Integration** (structuring in warehouses).
  * **Enabling BI & Analytics** (semantic modeling).
